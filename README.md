# Market Demand Classification

## Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

### Project Overview:
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on Contract Review and Classification, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to categorize financial contracts into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.

## Project Title:
**Market Demand Classification using Natural Language Processing**

## Project Abstract:
This study explores the classification of real estate properties using key demand indicators such as location, available amenities, and prevailing market trends. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to provide insights into property desirability, enabling real estate agents to forecast future market dynamics effectively. The classification helps in identifying high-demand areas, tailoring marketing efforts, and optimizing pricing strategies to enhance decision-making and maximize returns.

## Algorithms Used:
### Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Decision Tree  
- Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbours  

### Deep Learning Algorithms:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
- Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)  
- Hybrid Model combining CNN and BiLSTM  

### Language Models:
- RoBERTa  
- BERT  

## Conclusion:
Classifying properties based on demand indicators proves to be a valuable approach in the real estate sector. By leveraging text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, and supervised learning models, the system accurately categorizes clauses into low, medium and high.
